“ ‘We want to be loved,’ ” quotes Britt-Marie. “ ‘Failing that, admired; failing that, feared; failing that, hated and despised. At all costs we want to stir up some sort of feeling in others. The soul abhors a vacuum. At all costs it longs for contact.’ ”
Elsa is not quite sure what this means, but she nods all the same. “What do you want to be, then?”
“It’s complicated being a grown-up sometimes, Elsa,” Britt-Marie says evasively.
“It’s not, like, easy-peasy being a kid either,” Elsa replies belligerently.
The tips of Britt-Marie’s fingers wander carefully over the white circle on the skin of her ring finger.
“I used to stand on the balcony early in the mornings. Before Kent woke up. Your grandmother knew this, that’s why she made those snowmen. And that’s why I got so angry. Because she knew my secret and it felt as if she and the snowmen were trying to taunt me for it.”
“What secret?”
Britt-Marie clasps her hands together firmly.
“I was never like your grandmother. I never traveled. I was just here. But sometimes I liked to stand on the balcony in the mornings, when it was windy. It’s silly, of course, everyone obviously thinks it’s silly, they do, of course.” She purses her mouth. “But I like to feel the wind in my hair.”
Elsa thinks about how Britt-Marie may, despite everything, not be a total shit after all.
“You didn’t answer the question—what do you want to be?” she says, winding her scarf through her fingers. Britt-Marie’s fingertips move hesitantly over her skirt, like a person moving across a dance floor to ask someone to dance. And then, cautiously, she utters the words:
“I want someone to remember I existed. I want someone to know I was here.”
